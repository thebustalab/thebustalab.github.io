description: "Geocomputation with R is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization, and geospatial capabilities. The book equips you with the knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues manifested in geographic data, including those with scientific, societal, and environmental implications. This book will interest people from many backgrounds, especially Geographic Information Systems (GIS) users interested in applying their domain-specific knowledge in a powerful open source language for data science, and R users interested in extending their skills to handle spatial data."

1. Analytical chemists separate, identify, and quantify matter. To connect this data with the world around us and answer scientific questions, multiple chemical entities must be separated, quantified, and identified. Challenge 1: As our ability to collect analytical data expands, so must our ability to effectively analyze that data - whether it’s 10 data points or 10,000.

2. One of the largest obstacles facing scientists is communicating about our work with non-scientists. Challenge 2: We must practice oral and written science communication in both technical and non-technical formats.

This course is a set of first steps toward meeting both challenges outlined above. In the first half, we’ll explore, critique, and practice methods of handling and communicating about the data generated in large analytical chemistry projects. In the second half, we’ll apply the methods to large datasets and hone our writing skills by developing mini manuscripts that incorporate our large datasets.
