Multiple regression and ANCOVA are statistically equivalent.,"""FALSE""",TRUE,"ANCOVA can be represented as multiple regression with dummies for all response categories, and one continuous predictor. Topic: background knowledge."
The error term ($\epsilon_i$) in regression equations reflects how much the observed scores of individuals differ from their predicted scores.,"""FALSE""",TRUE,"This term e_i represents the 'residuals'; the variance not explained by the regression line. We assume that these residuals are normally distributed around 0, which means people's scores are normally distributed around the regression line. Topic: background knowledge."
"In the equation $Y_i = a + bX_i + e_i$, what are the 'model parameters'?","c(""$Y_i, X_i$ and $e_i$"", ""$Y$ and $X$"", ""$a$ and $bX_i$"")",$a$ and $b$,"The 'parameters' are the quantities we want to estimate. In this case, we have observed data for X_i and Y_i. We then estimate the intercept a and slope b. Then, we can calculate the residuals e_i. Topic: Model parameters, see lecture."
"A psychologist administers a test intended to measure intelligence. Participants complete different puzzles and answer different questions. From a measurement theory point of view, what kind of variable is intelligence in this context?","c(""An observed variable"", ""A measurement variable"", ""A dependent variable"")",A latent variable,"The puzzles and questions are observed variables. These are intended to measure an unobserved, 'latent' construct: intelligence. From a modeling perspective, the observed variables are dependent on the latent variable, not the other way around. Topic: factor analysis, see lecture."
What are degrees of freedom?,"c(""The number of unique pieces of information"", ""Number of participants minus number of parameters"", ""The number of parameters"")",The number of unique pieces of information minus number of parameters,"Degrees of freedom are the number of remaining parameters you *could* estimate, given a number of unique pieces of information. For example, if you have 10 participants, you could estimate maximum 10 parameters. If you then estimate 2 parameters, you have 8 remaining degrees of freedom. Note that in SEM, the pieces of information are not individual participants, but the observed (co)variances and sometimes means. Topic: degrees of freedom, see lecture."
A model with more degrees of freedom is...,"""more complex""",more simple,"More degrees of freedom means fewer parameters are estimated, so the model is simpler. Topic: fit vs complexity, see lecture."
A model with more degrees of freedom will...,"""fit the data better""",fit the data worse,"The simpler a model is, the more poorly it will represent the data. The most complex model possible exactly reproduces the observed data, and has 0 degrees of freedom. Topic: fit vs complexity, see lecture."
"In OLS regression, a model is fit to the individual participant data. By contrast, regression in structural equation modeling fits a model to the observed covariance matrix.","""FALSE""",TRUE,"Structural equation models are usually fit to the observed covariance matrix, and sometimes a mean vector. In bivariate regression, the covariance between X and Y is modeled as a function of X. Topic: covariance matrix, see lecture."
