/*
 * r_highlight.js — a small R tokenizer, and the syntax highlighting built on it.
 *
 * Editing this file? Read integrated_bioanalytics/_agent_reference/webr_surfaces.md first — the design decisions, the failure histories and the anti-"improvement" guards live there.
 *
 * WHY WE HAVE OUR OWN. The book colours its code with **downlit**, which runs inside R at render time
 * (it even links function names to their docs). It cannot run in a browser, so the sandbox — where the
 * code is typed, not rendered — needs its own tokenizer.
 *
 * It emits **downlit's class names** (`fu`/`va`/`st`/`op`/`co`/`fl`/`cn`/`cf`) rather than inventing its
 * own, so the sandbox and the book describe the same things the same way. The *colours* differ and must:
 * downlit's palette is built for a white page (`va` is navy `#19177c`), and the sandbox editor is dark.
 * `sandbox.html` maps these classes to lifted versions of the same hues — functions blue, strings green,
 * numbers pink, comments grey — so the two read as the same scheme without being illegible.
 *
 * PURE ON PURPOSE — no DOM, no CDN import, no WebR. That is what makes it testable in Node without a
 * browser or a ~40 s WebR boot (`tests/r_highlight.test.mjs`), the pattern this book's AGENTS.md already
 * calls out for `webr_view.js`. Keep it that way: the DOM half lives in `sandbox.html`.
 *
 * The token stream is deliberately CONTIGUOUS and carries offsets — every character of the input belongs
 * to exactly one token, including whitespace. Two things depend on that: `highlightHTML()` can simply
 * concatenate, and a future bracket/quote checker can walk the same stream and know which `(` are real
 * code and which are inside a string or a comment (the whole reason a naive bracket count is wrong).

 *
 * type: co comment · st string · cn constant · cf control-flow · fu function call · va name
 *       fl number · op operator/punctuation · ws whitespace
 *
 * Unterminated strings are not an error here — the student is mid-typing most of the time, and a
 * tokenizer that throws would blank the highlight on every other keystroke. The token is returned with
 * `unterminated: true` instead, so a checker can report it and the colouring stays stable meanwhile.
