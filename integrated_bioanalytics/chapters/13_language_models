<!-- ## completions {-} -->

<!-- You can run completions using: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- completionGPT( -->
<!--   system_prompt = "", -->
<!--   query = "", -->
<!--   model = "", -->
<!--   temperature = 0, -->
<!--   openai_api_key = "" -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The `system_prompt` tells the model how to act. For example, you might say `system_prompt = "you are a helpful assistant"`. -->

<!-- The `query` is the question you want to ask. For example, you might say: `query = "Below is some text from a scientific article, but I don't quite understand it. Could you explain it in simple terms? Text: The goal of the study presented was to compare Tanacetum balsamita L. (costmary) and Tanacetum vulgare L. (tansy) in terms of the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of their essential oils and hydroethanolic extracts, and to relate these activities with their chemical profiles. The species under investigation differed in their chemical composition and biological activities. The dominant compounds of the essential oils, as determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), were β-thujone in costmary (84.43%) and trans-chrysanthenyl acetate in tansy (18.39%). Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection (HPLC-DAD), the chemical composition of phenolic acids and flavonoids were determined. Cichoric acid was found to be the dominant phenolic compound in both species (3333.9 and 4311.3 mg per 100g, respectively). The essential oil and extract of costmary displayed stronger antibacterial activity (expressed as Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values) than those of tansy. Conversely, tansy extract had higher antioxidant potential (determined by Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) and DPPH assays) compared to costmary. In light of the observed antibacterial and antioxidant activities, the herbs of tansy and costmary could be considered as promising products for the pharmaceutical and food industries, specifically as antiseptic and preservative agents.` -->

<!-- ## createNewsletter {-} -->

<!-- The `createNewsletter()` function provides an automated way to gather, organize, and share the latest research findings in specified focus areas. Using the createNewsletter function, you can input search terms that will be used as queries in a PubMed search. You also provide focus areas that gpt-3.5-turbo uses to rank the results of the PubMed searches. createNewsletter then compiles the n_articles_per_newsletter top ranked hits into a formatted newsletter. The image_prompt is used to create a header image for the newsletter. By modifying search_terms and focus_areas, you can tailor the newsletter to keep up with cutting-edge research in your field. -->

<!-- With createNewsletter, you can optionally also monitor a directory on the computer system you are using. Anything in the monitored_directory (and its subdirectories) that was added within the past number of hours indicated in monitored_time_window that has a suffix matching monitored_file_suffix (only .txt files currently supported) will be added to the newsletter. This allows your newsletter to include not only PubMed search results but also files stored in a specific directory (like a collection of chunked .pdf files). -->

<!-- ## prompting strategies {-} -->


<!-- Role and Goal-Based Constraints: These constraints narrow the AI's response range, making it more appropriate and effective. Leveraging the AI's pre-trained knowledge, they guide conversation within a specific persona. -->

<!-- Step-by-Step Instructions: Clarity and organization in instructions are crucial. It's recommended to use simple, direct language and to break down complex problems into steps. This approach, including the "Chain of Thought" method, helps the AI follow and effectively respond to the user's request. -->

<!-- Expertise and Pedagogy: The user's knowledge and perspective play a vital role in guiding the AI. The user should have a clear vision of how the AI should respond and interact, especially in educational or pedagogical settings. -->

<!-- Constraints: Setting rules or conditions within prompts helps guide the AI's behavior and makes its responses more predictable. This includes defining roles (like a tutor), limiting response lengths, and controlling the flow of conversation. -->

<!-- Personalization: Using prompts that solicit information and ask questions can help the AI adapt to different scenarios and provide more personalized responses. -->

<!-- Examples and Few-Shot Learning: Providing the AI with a few examples helps it understand and adapt to new tasks better than with zero-shot learning. -->

<!-- Asking for Specific Output: Experimenting with different types of outputs, such as images, charts, or documents, can leverage the AI's capabilities. -->

<!-- Appeals to Emotion: Recent research suggests that adding emotional phrases to requests can improve the quality of AI responses. Different phrases may be effective in different contexts. -->

<!-- Testing and Feedback: It's important to test prompts with various inputs and perspectives to ensure they are effective and helpful. Continuous tweaking based on feedback can improve the prompts further. -->

<!-- Sharing and Collaboration: Sharing structured prompts allows others to learn and apply them in different contexts, fostering a collaborative environment for AI use. -->

<!-- # analyzeLiterature {-}

If you have access to the bustalab server, you can run the command `analyzeLiterature()` in an R chunk and connect to a shiny app that stores the Busta Lab's literature database. Here are some example questions that you can ask of our literature database:

- Simple question: What are wax blooms?

- Medium-Complexity question: How are ABC transporters involved in the movement of cuticle-related compounds?

- High-Complexity question: Can you describe what is known about the transcriptional regulation of lipid transfer proteins in plants?

- Can you explain - Conceptual: I don't understand the following passage, can you summarize it in simple terms?

 "In earlier studies, different other compounds including β-amyrin were overproduced through using strong constitutive promoters [12], enhancers [13] and transcription factors [14]. The β-amyrin is the triterpenoids belongs to oleanane group [15], which harbors anti-hyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic effects along with several other pharmacological activities [16,17]. The β-amyrin synthase (βAS) is responsible to synthesize the β-amyrin from 2,3-oxidosqualene[18]. This 2,3-oxidosqualene is synthesized from squalene through squalene epoxidase (SQE), encoded by the ERG1 gene in S. cerevisiae [19]. Squalene is synthesized from farnesyl-pyrophosphate through the
action of squalene synthase (SQS) (ERG9 gene); and this farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP) is synthesized by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) (ERG20 gene), from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a precursor supplied by mevalonate (MVA) pathway (Fig. 1). The 3-Hydroxy-3-Methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG1) [20,21] and squalene
monooxygenase or SQE [22] are the rate-limiting enzymes of the terpenoid pathway in yeast. For the biosynthesis of triterpenoids, SQS and SQE are important enzymes [23] and were previously overexpressed for
the overproduction of triterpenoids [14,24]."

- Can you explain - Method/technique: Can you summarize the GAL4/RUBY assay in simple terms?  -->
