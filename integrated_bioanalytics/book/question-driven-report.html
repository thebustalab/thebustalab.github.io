<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chemical Pollutants in Minnesota Soils</strong><br></p>
<p>In order to better understand pollution in the state of Minnesota, this study focused on a detailed analyses of chemical measurements from soil samples from 300 sites around the state. The analyses consisted of a principal components analysis to determine which sites were similar to one another, thus answering the question of what sites exhibited similar pollutant profiles (Section 2.1). This first analysis was followed by statistical tests to see whether differences could be detected in the sites’ chemistry, answering the question of whether there were any significant differences in the pollutant profiles at each site (Section 2.2).<br></p>
<p><em>2.1 Principal Components Analysis</em><br></p>
<p>To understand relationships between the sites from which soil chemistry was sampled, a principal components analysis was used. Each of the 20 different analytes, all of which contained halogen atoms, were included in the analysis. A scatter plot showing the position of each of the 300 samples in a space defined by dimesions 1 and 2 (which explain 54% and 35% of the total variance of the dataset, respectively), revealed that two major clusters are present, with a small number of outliers (Fig. 1). By color coding these two clusters according to whether the samples were collected from rural versus urban areas, it was possible to see that the first cluster was made out of almost exclusively samples from urban areas, while the second cluster was made up of almost entirely samples from rural areas. This suggested that variance in pollutant chemistry among the samples collected was assocaited with urban versus rural environments.<br></p>
<p><em>2.2 Statistical Analyses</em><br></p>
<p>Using the groupings that were identified via principal components analysis, statistical tests were conducted to determine if chemical abundances differed between groups. Tests for normality and homogeneity of variance (Shapiro and Levene tests) revealed that the data could not be assessed using ANOVA but instead required the use of a non-parametric test. Accordingly, the Kruskall-Wallis test followed by post-hoc Dunn tests were applied, which showed that the abundances of halogenated pollutants is significantly higher in urban versus rural areas (p = 0.0035, Fig. 2A). These direct observations are consistent with conclusions drawn by others in recent literature reviews focused on hydrocarbon compounds (Petrucci et al., 2018; Hendrix et al., 2019). <em>Thus, the new chemical analyses presented here demonstrate that the discrepancy in urban versus rural pollution is true not only for hydrocarbon compounds (as had been found previously), but also for halogenated compounds.</em> Together, these findings strongly suggest that either cities are a source of more pollution or that there is some other mechanism that concentrates pollution in cities.<br></p>

<ul>
<li>“The GC-MS data presented here indicates that cities have higher levels of pollution than rural areas (Fig. 1),” (a data feature)</li>

<li>“The GC-MS data presented here indicates that cities have higher levels of pollution than rural areas.” (data feature)</li>
<li>“These direct observations are consistent with conclusions drawn by others in recent literature reviews (Petrucci., 2018; Hendrix et al., 2019)” (literature information)</li>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Group “data feature” -&gt; “supp/lit info” -&gt; “conclusion” combinations into paragraphs.</strong> Edit each conclusion so that it highlights what new contribution your data makes to the situation.

</ol>
<ul>
<li>“The GC-MS data presented here indicates that cities have higher levels of pollution than rural areas (Fig. 1). These direct observations are consistent with meta-analyses of previously published observations (Supplemental Figure 1), as well as with conclusions drawn by others in recent literature reviews (So and so et al., 2018; The other person et al., 2019). <em>The new chemical analyses presented here thus confirm this is true for hydrocarbon compounds, and extend the observation to halogenated compounds in the atmosphere.</em> Together these findings strongly suggest that either cities are a source of more pollution or that there is some other mechanism that concentrates pollution in cities.</li>
