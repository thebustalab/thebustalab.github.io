If you already have R installed, you can go straight to installing RStudio. If not, follow these steps to install R: Go to https://cran.r-project.org/ Click on “Download R for &lt;your operating system&gt;” (see footnote), depending on your operating system you will select “Download R for Linux”, “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, or “Download R for Windows”. footnote: We will use &lt;this notation&gt; quite a bit. It indicates a place where you should insert information, data, or something similar that corresponds to your particular situation. In this example it means insert “your operating system”, i.e. Linux, (Mac) OS X, or Windows. For Mac: download the .pkg file for the latest release. As of 8/31/2020, this is R-4.0.2.pkg. For PC: click “install R for the first time”, then click “Download R 4.0.2 for Windows”. After the executable finishes downloading (in Windows, it is a file with .exe extension; for Mac, it is a .dmg file or a .dmg inside a .pkg file), open the file as an administrator, and follow the installation instructions. R should install without any problems. You can click OK for all of the windows that pop-up during installation, and choose a “regular” installation (if given the choice). If you have trouble installing R please google “Install R Mac” or “Install R PC” and following one the many video tutorials out there. If you have tried this and are still having trouble, please contact me. 1.2 Installing RStudio Once we install R, we can install RStudio, which is essentially a convenient way of interacting with R. Some people do not like RStudio and prefer to interact with R directly. This is fine, but many beginning R users find RStudio helpful, so I recommend it. Follow these steps to install RStudio: Go to https://rstudio.com/ Click “DOWNLOAD” at the top of the page. Click the “DOWNLOAD” button that corresponds to RStudio Desktop with the free Open Source License. The page may automatically detect which operating system you are using and recommend a version for you. If it does, download that file (.exe for PC or .dmg for Mac). If not, scroll down to the “All Installers” section and download the file that is right for you. Open the file as an administrator, and follow the installation instructions. RStudio should install without any problems. You can click OK for all of the windows that pop-up during installation, and choose a “regular” installation (if given the choice). If you have trouble installing RStudio please google “Install RStudio Mac” or “Install RStudio PC” and following one the many video tutorials out there. If you have tried this and are still having trouble, please contact me. 1.3 Check your installations of R and RStudio Open RStudio by clicking on the appropriate file in your applications folder, or wherever it is saved on your computer. You will see several windows. One is the Code Editor, one is the R Console, one is the Workspace and History, and one is the Plots and Files window. The R Console window should have a carat in it. Type head(Indomet). This should display the first six lines of a data set describing the pharmacokinets of indomethacin. This is one of the built in datasets in R. head(Indometh) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## Subject time conc ## &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 0.25 1.5 ## 2 1 0.5 0.94 ## 3 1 0.75 0.78 ## 4 1 1 0.48 ## 5 1 1.25 0.37 ## 6 1 2 0.19 Next, type plot(Indometh) into the R Console. This will plot the indomethacin dataset in a basic way. plot(Indometh) If both the above commands (head(Indometh) and plot(Indometh)) worked and there were no error messages during installation, then you should be ready to proceed. 1.4 Install phylochemistry directly from github and view documentation contents devtools::install_github(&quot;LucasBusta/phylochemistry&quot;, quiet = FALSE, force = TRUE) ## Downloading GitHub repo LucasBusta/phylochemistry@master ## checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/d4/m9ll00q10hdd6kz0vk9q0nx80000gn/T/Rtmp04nFW7/remotes127f43ffe8406/LucasBusta-phylochemistry-75de128/DESCRIPTION’ ... ✓ checking for file ‘/private/var/folders/d4/m9ll00q10hdd6kz0vk9q0nx80000gn/T/Rtmp04nFW7/remotes127f43ffe8406/LucasBusta-phylochemistry-75de128/DESCRIPTION’ ## ─ preparing ‘phylochemistry’: ## checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... ✓ checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ## ─ checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts ## ─ checking for empty or unneeded directories ## ─ building ‘phylochemistry_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz’ ## ## packages &lt;- c(&quot;phylochemistry&quot;) lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE) ## [[1]] ## [1] TRUE help(package = &quot;phylochemistry&quot;) "]
