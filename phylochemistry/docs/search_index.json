First we need some data. Let’s use this cool algae chemistry dataset. First, remember that RSudio operates as a session. This means that we need to make sure any libraries/packages we need are available to the current session. To import data, let’s use the tidyverse function called read_csv. This means we need to first make sure the tidyverse is loaded into the current session, then we can run the read_csv command. library(tidyverse) Next, we need to find the path to our data. If you are on a PC, right-click the file of interest (in this case algae_data.csv), go to preferences, then copy the … If you are on a Mac, find the file right-click on it, hold down the option key, and then click “Copy as pathname”. One you have the path, insert it IN QUOTES into the read_csv command. # read_csv() "]]
