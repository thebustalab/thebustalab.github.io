/*
 * chapter_alaska.js — content for the Alaska chapter ("Signal in the Cold").
 *
 * Data only; the flow lives in play.html. A chapter is a chain of pseudo-360 pano
 * rooms: each has one practice puzzle (a WebR editor task gated by a multiple-choice
 * answer that is the *product* of running the analysis) and a door that opens on
 * solve and leads to the next room. This chapter drills dplyr::filter(); the boss
 * (room 4, the helipad) is a figure deliverable — not built in this slice.
 *
 * Hotspot positions are boxes [x0,y0,x1,y1] as fractions of the flat scene image
 * (same convention as the harness); the viewer maps box-centre -> yaw/pitch across
 * the room's wrap coverage. Nudge them in the harness later if needed.
