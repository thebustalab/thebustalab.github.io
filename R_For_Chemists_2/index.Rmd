1. Analytical chemists separate, identify, and quantify matter. To connect this data with the world around us and answer scientific questions, multiple chemical entities must be separated, quantified, and identified. Challenge 1: As our ability to collect analytical data expands, so must our ability to effectively analyze that data - whether it’s 10 data points or 10,000. 

2. One of the largest obstacles facing scientists is communicating about our work with non-scientists. Challenge 2: We must practice oral and written science communication in both technical and non-technical formats.

This course is a set of first steps toward meeting both challenges outlined above. In the first half, we’ll explore, critique, and practice methods of handling and communicating about the data generated in large analytical chemistry projects. In the second half, we’ll apply the methods to large datasets and hone our writing skills by developing mini manuscripts that incorporate our large datasets.

<!-- start Installation-->

# Installation

## R

R is the computing language we will use to run our chemometric analyses and produce high quality plots. If you already have R installed, you can go straight to installing RStudio. If not, follow these steps to install R:

1. Go to https://cran.r-project.org/

2. Click on "Download R for \<your operating system\>" (see footnote), depending on your operating system you will select "Download R for Linux", "Download R for (Mac) OS X", or "Download R for Windows".

  <div class="marginnote">

  We will use \<this notation\> quite a bit. It indicates a place where you should insert information, data, or something similar that corresponds to your particular situation. In this example it means insert "your operating system", i.e. Linux, (Mac) OS X, or Windows.

  </div>

3. For Mac: download the .pkg file for the latest release. For PC: click "install R for the first time", then click "Download R \<version\> for Windows".

4. After the executable finishes downloading (in Windows, it is a file with .exe extension; for Mac, it is a .dmg file or a .dmg inside a .pkg file), open the file as an administrator, and follow the installation instructions. R should install without any problems. You can click OK for all of the windows that pop-up during installation, and choose a "regular" installation (if given the choice). 

  <div class="marginnote">

  If you have trouble installing R please google "Install R Mac" or "Install R PC" and follow one the many video tutorials out there. If you have tried this and are still having trouble, please contact me.

  </div>

## RStudio

Once we install R, we can install RStudio, which is essentially a convenient way of interacting with R. Some people do not like RStudio and prefer to interact with R directly. This is fine, but many beginning R users find RStudio helpful, so I recommend it. Follow these steps to install RStudio:

1. Go to https://rstudio.com/

2. Click "DOWNLOAD" at the top of the page.

3. Click the "DOWNLOAD" button that corresponds to RStudio Desktop with the free Open Source License.

4. The page may automatically detect which operating system you are using and recommend a version for you. If it does, download that file (.exe for PC or .dmg for Mac). If not, scroll down to the "All Installers" section and download the file that is right for you. Open the file as an administrator, and follow the installation instructions. RStudio should install without any problems. You can click OK for all of the windows that pop-up during installation, and choose a "regular" installation (if given the choice). 

If you have trouble installing RStudio please google "Install RStudio Mac" or "Install RStudio PC" and following one the many video tutorials out there. If you have tried this and are still having trouble, please contact me.

## Verification

Open RStudio by clicking on the appropriate file in your applications folder, or wherever it is saved on your computer. You will see several windows. One is the Code Editor, one is the R Console, one is the Workspace and History, and one is the Plots and Files window.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), results="markup"}
knitr:::include_graphics('http://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/figures/rstudio_components.png', dpi = NA)
```

The R Console window should have a `>` in it. Type `head(Indometh)`. This should display the first six lines of a data set describing the pharmacokinets of indomethacin. This is one of the built in datasets in R - you do not need any additional files to run this test.

```{r, message = FALSE}
head(Indometh)
```

Next, type `plot(Indometh)` into the R Console. This will plot the indomethacin dataset in a basic way.

```{r, message = FALSE}
plot(Indometh)
```

If both the above commands (`head(Indometh)` and `plot(Indometh)`) worked and there were no error messages during installation, then you should be ready to proceed.

## tidyverse

For us to run our analyses, we need to install a set of add-on functions that expand R's capabilities. These functions are collected in something called the `tidyverse`, a very well-known and widely-used R package. You do not need to manually download anything to complete this installation - R will do it for you. In the R Console, type `install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")` to install the tidyverse.

  <div class="marginnote">

  RSudio might ask you: "Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", for now, type `no` and press enter.

  </div>

```{r, message = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

Let's make sure your version of the `tidyverse` is installed correctly. To do this, we will load the `tidyverse` library/package inside of an R session. We can do this using `library(tidyverse)`. Let's try it:
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If the library load correctly - then you are set to go! If not, try updating your R / RStudio installations, the re installing the `tidyverse`. If this still fails, please contact me.

## TeX

In this class we will generate high quality reports suitable for submission to supervisors, academic journals, etc. For this, we need the typesetting engine TeX. There are a few ways to do this. The easiest way is using the following commands:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('tinytex', 'rmarkdown'))
```

  <div class="marginnote">

  If you are on Mac, you may get an error about "not being able to write to a path" or something like that. In that case you probably need to open your terminal and run the following two commands: 

  sudo chown -R \`whoami\`:admin /usr/local/bin 

  and then 

  ~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/\*/tlmgr path add

  </div>

Then, on both Mac and PC, you then need to do:
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Other options are: if you have Windows, download and install [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download). If you have OSX, you can download and install [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).

## phylochemistry

In addition to the `tidyverse`, there are a variety of other packages we will need, as well as some datasets and custom functions. These call all be loaded by doing the following.

First, attempt to load `phylochemistry`:
```{r, message = FALSE}
source("http://thebustalab.github.io/phylochemistry/phylochemistry.R")
```

The first time you try this, it will very likely say: "You need to install the following packages before proceeding […] Run: installPhylochemistry() to automatically install the required packages."

This means that some of the prerequisite packages that phylochemistry needs are not installed. If this happens, run the following:
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
installPhylochemistry()
```
  <div class="marginnote">

  Sometimes when you run `installPhylochemistry()` you will get a message:

  `Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:`

  In this case, it is generally advisable to enter `a` into the console and then press enter, indicating to R that you wish to update anything and everything that can be updated.

  Other times you may get this message:

  `Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)`

  You can reply `yes` if you wish, but for simplicity's sake it is okay to say `no`. I usually start with saying `no`, only reverting to `yes` if things don't work down the line.

  </div>

Once that is complete, and assuming no errors are displayed, attempt to load phylochemistry again:
```{r, message = FALSE}
source("http://thebustalab.github.io/phylochemistry/phylochemistry.R")
```

# R Markdown {#R_Markdown}

## Objects

Ok, we've got the installation out of the way. Let's get down to working with data and generating reports! In R, data is stored in objects. You can think of objects as if they were "files" inside an R session. `phylochemistry` provides a variety of objects for us to work with. 


Let's look at how to create an object. For this, we can use an arrow: `<-` . The arrow will take something and store it inside an object. For example:

```{r}
new_object <- 1
```

Now we've got a new object called `new_object`, and inside of it is the number 1. To look at what's inside an object, we can simply type the name of the object into the console:

```{r}
new_object
```

Easy! Let's look at one of the objects that comes with 

```{r, message = FALSE}
algae_data
```

## Functions

Excellent - we've got data. Now we need to manipulate it. For this we need functions:

* A function is a command that tells R to perform an action!
* A function begins and ends with parentheses: `this_is_a_function()`
* The stuff inside the parentheses are the details of how you want the function to perform its action: `run_this_analysis(on_this_data)`

Let's illustrate this with an example. `algae_data` is a pretty big object. For our next chapter on visualization, it would be nice to have a smaller dataset object to work with. Let's use another `tidyverse` command called `filter` to filter the `algae_data` object. We will need to tell the filter command what to filter out using "logical predicates" (things like equal to: `==`, less than: `<`, greater than: `>`, greater-than-or-equal-to: `<=`, etc.). Let's filter `algae_data` so that only rows where the `chemical_species` is equal to `FAs` (fatty acids) is preserved. This will look like `chemical_species == "FAs"`. Here we go:

```{r, message = FALSE}
filter(algae_data, chemical_species == "FAs")
```

Cool! Now it's just showing us the 18 rows where the chemical_species is fatty acids (FAs). Let's write this new, smaller dataset into a new object. For that we use `<-`, remember?

```{r, message = FALSE}
algae_data_small <- filter(algae_data, chemical_species == "FAs")
algae_data_small
```

Now we have a nice, small table that we can use to practice data visualization.

## Markdown Reports

Let's look at how to create an R Markdown report - this is what we will use to submit assignments in this class. You can also use markdown to create reports for your research group or other projects.

First, in RStudio click `File -> New File -> R Markdown`. This will open a default report for you. When you compile it by clicking "knit" it should look something like this:



  <div class="marginnote">

  You can access a variety of Markdown themes here: [R Markdown Themes](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)

  </div>

<!-- end -->

<!-- start ggplot2 -->
# ggplot2 {#ggplot2}

For visualization, we're going to use `ggplot2` - a powerful set of commands for plot generation. Let's make sure we've got our data from the last chapter active in our current session:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
algae_data_small <- filter(algae_data, chemical_species == "FAs")
algae_data_small
```

Great! Looks like we're ready to go.

## Setting up a ggplot

There are three steps to setting up a ggplot:

### Step 1: Define the data you want to use.

We do this using the ggplot function's data argument. When we run that line, it just shows a grey plot space. Why is this? It's because all we've done is told ggplot that (i) we want to make a plot and (ii) what data should be used. We haven't explained how to represent features of the data using ink.

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small)
```

### Step 2: Define how your variables map onto the axes.

This is called aesthetic mapping and is done with the `aes()` function. `aes()` should be placed inside the `ggplot` command. Now when we run it, we get our axes!

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance))
```

### Step 3: Use geometric shapes to represent other variables in your data.

Map your variables onto the geometric features of the shapes. To define which shape should be used, use a `geom_*` command. Some options are, for example, `geom_point()`, `geom_boxplot()`, and `geom_violin()`. These functions should be added to your plot using the `+` sign. We can use a new line to keep the code from getting too wide, just make sure the `+` sign is at the end fo the top line. Again, use `aes()` to map your variables onto the geometric features of the shapes. Let's try it:

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime))
```

## Geoms

### Modifying geoms

In the last plot in the previous section, the points were a bit small, how could we fix that? We can modify the features of the shapes by adding additional arguments to the `geom_*()` functions. To change the size of the points created by the `geom_point()` function, this means that we need to add the `size = ` argument. Here's an example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5)
```

One powerful aspect of `ggplot` is the ability to quickly change mappings to see if alternative plots are more effective at bringing out the trends in the data. For example, we could modify the plot above by switching how harvesting_regime is mapped:

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = harvesting_regime), color = "black")
```

** Important note: Inside the `aes()` function, map aesthetics (the features of the geom's shape) to a *variable*. Outside the `aes()` function, map aesthetics to *constants*. You can see this in the above two plots - in the first one, color is inside `aes()` and mapped to the variable called harvesting_regime, while size is outside the `aes()` call and is set to the constant 5. In the second plot, the situation is reversed, with size being inside the `aes()` function and mapped to the variable harvesting_regime, while color is outside the `aes()` call and is mapped to the constant "black".

### Using multiple geoms

We can also stack geoms on top of one another by using multiple `+` signs. We also don't have to assign the same mappings to each geom.

```{r}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5)
```

As you can probably guess right now, there are lots of mappings that can be done, and lots of different ways to look at the same data!

```{r}
ggplot(data = algae_data_small, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = algae_strain)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime, size = replicate))
```

<!-- start Exercises 1 -->
# Exercises 1 {#Exercises_1}

In this set of exercises we're going to practice importing, filtering, and plotting data. We're going to work with two datasets: (i) algae_data_data and (ii) alaska_lake_data. **For these exercises, you will write your code and answers to any questions in an R Markdown report, compile it as a pdf, and submit it on Canvas. If you have any questions please let me know**

## Part 1: Algae Chemistry Dataset

<!-- 1. **Importing data**

Import the algae chemistry data. Remember that `read_csv()` is part of the `tidyverse`, so that library needs to be loaded into your `R` session. Also remember that another option is to paste and run `readCSV <- function() { return(readr::read_csv(file.choose())) }` in your R Console, which then gives you access to the function `readCSV()`. That command doesn't require an input path, so you don't need to mess around with slashes and quotes. If you need examples of how to import data, please see the [R Basics](#R_Basics) section of this book.

```{r, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("https://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/sample_data/algae_data.csv")
```

2. **Dataset dimensions**

How many rows and columns does the algae chemistry dataset have? (hint: when you display the dataset on your screen by typing its name into the console, dimensions are also displayed). Write the answer to this question in your R Script right below the code you use to find the answer.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("https://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/sample_data/algae_data.csv")
# 180 x 5
```

3. **Objects**

Import the algae chemistry data and send it into a new object called `algae_data_data`. Remember about `<-`. See the [R Basics](#R_Basics) section of this book if you need help.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
algae_data_data <- read_csv("https://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/sample_data/algae_data.csv")
```
 -->
1. **Filtering 1**

Now that you have the algae data imported and stored in an object called `algae_data_data`, filter the data so that only entries are shown for which the `chemical_species` is "FAs". What are the dimensions (i.e. number of rows and columns) of the resulting dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
filter(algae_data_data, chemical_species == "FAs")
# 18 x 5
```


2. **Filtering 2**

Now filter the dataset so that only entries for the `algae_strain` "Tsv1" are shown. What are the dimensions of the resulting dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
filter(algae_data_data, algae_strain == "Tsv1")
# 60 x 5
```

3. **Filtering 3**

Now filter the dataset so that only entries with an abundance greater than 250 are shown. Note that `>` can be used in the filter command instead of `==`, and that numbers inside a filter command do not require quotes around them. What are the dimensions of the resulting dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
filter(algae_data_data, abundance > 250)
# 71 x 5
```

4. **Plotting**

Make a ggplot that has `algae_strain` on the x axis and `abundance` on the y axis. Remember about `aes()`. Use points (`geom_point()`) to represent each compound. You don't need to color the points. If you need a refresher on how to make a ggplot, please refer to the chapter on [ggplot2](#ggplot2).

Which algae strain has the most abundant compound out of all the compounds in the dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_data, aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) + 
  geom_point()
#Tsv2
```

5. **Plotting**

Make a ggplot that has `abundance` on the x axis and `chemical_species` on the y axis. Use points to represent each compound. You don't need to color the points.

Generally speaking, what are the two most abundant classes of chemical species in these algae strains? (FAs/Fas stand for fatty acids, AAs/Aas stand for amino acids.)

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_data, aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) + 
  geom_point()
#non_essential_Aas and essential_Aas
```

6. **Filtering and plotting**

I am going to show you an example of how you can filter and plot at the same time:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
algae_data_data
ggplot(data = filter(algae_data_data, chemical_species == "essential_Aas"), aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) +
  geom_point()
```

Using the above as a template, make a plot that shows just `omega_3_polyunsaturated_Fas`, with algae_strain on the x axis, and abundance on the y axis. Color the points so that they correspond to `harvesting_regime`. Remember that mapping a feature of a shape onto a variable must be done inside `aes()`. Change the plot so that all the points are size = 5. Remember that mapping features of a shape to a constant needs to be done outside `aes()`. Which harvesting regime leads to higher levels of `omega_3_polyunsaturated_Fas`?

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
algae_data_data <- read_csv("https://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/sample_data/algae_data.csv")
ggplot(data = filter(algae_data_data, chemical_species == "omega_3_polyunsaturated_Fas"), aes(x = algae_strain, y = abundance)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5)
# light harvesting
```

8. **Filtering and plotting**

Use a combination of filtering and plotting to show the abundance of the different chemical species in just the `algae_strain` called "Tsv1". Use an x and y axis, as well as points to represent the measurements. Make point size correspond to the replicate, and color the points according to harvesting regime.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
algae_data_data <- read_csv("https://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/sample_data/algae_data.csv")
ggplot(data = filter(algae_data_data, algae_strain == "Tsv1"), aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime, size = replicate))
# light harvesting
```

9. **Open-ended plotting**

Make a plot that checks to see which `chemical_species` were more abundant under light as opposed to heavy `harvesting_regime` in all three replicates. Use filtered data so that just one `algae_strain` is shown, an x and a y axis, and points to represent the measurements. Make the points `size = 5` and also set the point's `alpha = 0.6`. The points should be colored according to harvesting_regime. Make 3 plots, one for each strain of algae.

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(algae_data_data, algae_strain == "Tsv1"), aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5, alpha = 0.6)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(algae_data_data, algae_strain == "Tsv2"), aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5, alpha = 0.6)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(algae_data_data, algae_strain == "Tsv11"), aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5, alpha = 0.6)
```

10. **A peek at what's to come...**

Take the code that you made for Question 9. Remove the filtering. Add the following line to the end of the plot: `facet_grid(.~algae_strain)`. Remember that adding things to plots is done with the `+` sign, so your code should look something like:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
ggplot(data = algae_data_data, aes(x = <something>, y = <something else>)) +
  geom_point(aes(<some things>), <some here too>) +
  facet_grid(.~algae_strain)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_data, aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5, alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_grid(.~algae_strain)
```

Also try, instead of `facet_grid(.~algae_strain)`, `facet_grid(algae_strain~.)` at the end of you plot command. (note the swap in the position of the `.~` relative to `algae_strain`). This means your code should look something like:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
ggplot(data = algae_data_data, aes(x = <something>, y = <something else>)) +
  geom_point(aes(<some things>), <some here too>) +
  facet_grid(algae_strain~.)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = algae_data_data, aes(x = abundance, y = chemical_species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = harvesting_regime), size = 5, alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_grid(algae_strain~.)
```

What advantages does this one extra line provide over what you had to do in question 9?

## Part 2: Alaska Lakes Dataset

1. **Importing Data**

Import the Alaska lakes dataset into R and store it in an object. You can download the dataset from the link at the top of this page of exercises.

```{r, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <- alaska_lake_data
```

2. **Objects**

How many variables are in the Alaska lakes dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
data
# 220 x 7
```

3. **Filtering**

Filter the data set so only meausurements of free elements are shown. Remember, it's `==`, not `=`. What are the dimensions of the resulting dataset?

```{r, include = FALSE}
filter(data, element_type == "free")
# 160 x 7
```

4. **Plotting**

Make a plot that shows the water temperatures of each lake. Don't worry if you get a warning message from R about "missing values". Which is the hottest lake? The coolest?

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = lake, y = water_temp)) + geom_point() + coord_flip()
# Lava Lake
# Desperation Lake
```

5. **Plotting**

Make a plot that shows the water temperature of each lake. The x axis should be `park`, the y axis `water temp`. Add geom_violin() to the plot first, then geom_point(). Make the points size = 5. Color the points according to water_temp. Which park has four lakes with very similar temperatures?

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = park, y = water_temp)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point(aes(color = water_temp), size = 5)
# GAAR
```

6. **Filtering and Plotting**

From the plot you made for question 5, it should be apparent that there is one lake in NOAT that is much warmer than the others. Filter the data so that only entries from `park == "NOAT"` are shown (note the double equals sign and the quotes around NOAT...). Combine this filtering with plotting and use geom_point() to make a plot that shows which specific lake that is.

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(filter(data, park == "NOAT"), aes(x = lake, y = water_temp)) + 
  geom_point()
# Lake Narvakrak
```

7. **Filtering and Plotting**

Make a plot that shows which lake has the highest abundance of sulfur.

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(filter(data, element == "S"), aes(x = lake, y = mg_per_L)) + 
  geom_point()
```

8. **Open-ended Plotting**

Make a plot that uses geom_point(). Set the "shape" aesthetic of the points to 21, i.e. `geom_point(aes(...), shape = 21)`. This gives you access to a new aesthetics: `fill`. It also changes the behaviour of the `color` aesthetic slightly. Here is an example:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
lake_data
ggplot(data = filter(lake_data, lake == "Lake_Narvakrak"), aes(x = lake, y = mg_per_L)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 10, color = "black", fill = "green")
```

Now we have lots of aesthetics we can map to: x, y, size, color, and fill (leave shape set to 21 for now). Make a plot of your own design. It should include filtering, and all the aesthetics listed above, though whether you map them to a variable or a constant is up to you.

```{r, include = FALSE}
ggplot(filter(data, element == "C"), aes(x = park, y = mg_per_L)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 10, aes(fill = park), color = "black")
```

When you are done with this plot, take a screen shot of it. Go to [THIS GOOGLE SHEET](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fpw-iyMCwtssBJvQW0mC0NMarqRy2GZY62Kjf6zURGM/edit?usp=sharing), make a slide for yourself (you don't have to include your name), and paste your screen shot there. Add a small caption that explains how your variables are mapped.
