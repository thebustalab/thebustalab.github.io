1. Analytical chemists separate, identify, and quantify matter. To connect this data with the world around us and answer scientific questions, multiple chemical entities must be separated, quantified, and identified. Challenge 1: As our ability to collect analytical data expands, so must our ability to effectively analyze that data - whether it’s 10 data points or 10,000. 

2. One of the largest obstacles facing scientists is communicating about our work with non-scientists. Challenge 2: We must practice oral and written science communication in both technical and non-technical formats.

This course is a set of first steps toward meeting both challenges outlined above. In the first half, we’ll explore, critique, and practice methods of handling and communicating about the data generated in large analytical chemistry projects. In the second half, we’ll apply the methods to large datasets and hone our writing skills by developing mini manuscripts that incorporate our large datasets.

# Installation

## Installing `R`

R is the computing language we will use to run our chemometric analyses and produce high quality plots. If you already have R installed, you can go straight to installing RStudio. If not, follow these steps to install R:

1. Go to https://cran.r-project.org/

2. Click on "Download R for \<your operating system\>" (see footnote), depending on your operating system you will select "Download R for Linux", "Download R for (Mac) OS X", or "Download R for Windows".

  <div class="marginnote">

  We will use \<this notation\> quite a bit. It indicates a place where you should insert information, data, or something similar that corresponds to your particular situation. In this example it means insert "your operating system", i.e. Linux, (Mac) OS X, or Windows.

  </div>

3. For Mac: download the .pkg file for the latest release. For PC: click "install R for the first time", then click "Download R \<version\> for Windows".

4. After the executable finishes downloading (in Windows, it is a file with .exe extension; for Mac, it is a .dmg file or a .dmg inside a .pkg file), open the file as an administrator, and follow the installation instructions. R should install without any problems. You can click OK for all of the windows that pop-up during installation, and choose a "regular" installation (if given the choice). 

If you have trouble installing R please google "Install R Mac" or "Install R PC" and following one the many video tutorials out there. If you have tried this and are still having trouble, please contact me.

## Installing `RStudio`

Once we install R, we can install RStudio, which is essentially a convenient way of interacting with R. Some people do not like RStudio and prefer to interact with R directly. This is fine, but many beginning R users find RStudio helpful, so I recommend it. Follow these steps to install RStudio:

1. Go to https://rstudio.com/

2. Click "DOWNLOAD" at the top of the page.

3. Click the "DOWNLOAD" button that corresponds to RStudio Desktop with the free Open Source License.

4. The page may automatically detect which operating system you are using and recommend a version for you. If it does, download that file (.exe for PC or .dmg for Mac). If not, scroll down to the "All Installers" section and download the file that is right for you. Open the file as an administrator, and follow the installation instructions. RStudio should install without any problems. You can click OK for all of the windows that pop-up during installation, and choose a "regular" installation (if given the choice). 

If you have trouble installing RStudio please google "Install RStudio Mac" or "Install RStudio PC" and following one the many video tutorials out there. If you have tried this and are still having trouble, please contact me.

## Verifying installations

Open RStudio by clicking on the appropriate file in your applications folder, or wherever it is saved on your computer. You will see several windows. One is the Code Editor, one is the R Console, one is the Workspace and History, and one is the Plots and Files window.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), results="markup"}
knitr:::include_graphics('http://thebustalab.github.io/R_For_Chemists/figures/rstudio_components.png', dpi = NA)
```

The R Console window should have a `>` in it. Type `head(Indometh)`. This should display the first six lines of a data set describing the pharmacokinets of indomethacin. This is one of the built in datasets in R - you do not need any additional files to run this test.

```{r, message = FALSE}
head(Indometh)
```

Next, type `plot(Indometh)` into the R Console. This will plot the indomethacin dataset in a basic way.

```{r, message = FALSE}
plot(Indometh)
```

If both the above commands (`head(Indometh)` and `plot(Indometh)`) worked and there were no error messages during installation, then you should be ready to proceed.

## Installing the `tidyverse`

For us to run our analyses, we need to install a set of add-on functions that expand R's capabilities. These functions are collected in something called the `tidyverse`, a very well-known and widely-used R package developed by Hadley Wickham. You do not need to manually download anything to complete this installation - R will do it for you. In the R Console, type `install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")` to install the tidyverse. RSudio might ask you: "Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", for now, type `no` and press enter.

```{r, message = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

Let's make sure your version of the `tidyverse` is installed correctly. To do this, we will load the `tidyverse` library/package inside of an R session. We can do this using `library(tidyverse)`. Let's try it:
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If the library load correctly - then you are set to go! If not, try updating your R / RStudio installations, the re installing the `tidyverse`. If this still fails, please contact me.

## Installing TeX

In this class we will generate high quality reports suitable for submission to supervisors, academic journals, etc. For this, we need the typesetting engine TeX. There are a few ways to do this. The easiest way is using the following commands:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('tinytex', 'rmarkdown'))
```

  <div class="marginnote">

  If you are on Mac, you may get an error about "not being able to write to a path" or something like that. In that case you probably need to open your terminal and run the following two commands: 

  sudo chown -R \`whoami\`:admin /usr/local/bin 

  and then 

  ~/Library/TinyTeX/bin/\*/tlmgr path add

  </div>

Then, on both Mac and PC, you then need to do:
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Other options are: if you have Windows, download and install [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download). If you have OSX, you can download and install [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).

## Loading `phylochemistry`

In addition to the `tidyverse`, there are a variety of other packages we will need, as well as some datasets and custom functions. These call all be loaded by doing the following.

First, attempt to load `phylochemistry`:
```{r, message = FALSE}
source("http://thebustalab.github.io/phylochemistry/phylochemistry.R")
```

The first time you try this, it will very likely say: "You need to install the following packages before proceeding […] Run: installPhylochemistry() to automatically install the required packages."

This means that some of the prerequisite packages that phylochemistry needs are not installed. If this happens, run the following:
```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
installPhylochemistry()
```

Once that is complete, and assuming no errors are displayed, attempt to load phylochemistry again:
```{r, message = FALSE}
source("http://thebustalab.github.io/phylochemistry/phylochemistry.R")
```

## Objects

Ok, we've got the installation out of the way. Let's get down to working with data! In R, data is stored in objects. You can think of objects as if they were "files" inside an R session. `phylochemistry` provides a variety of objects for us to work with. To look at one, we can simply type the name of the object into the console:

```{r, message = FALSE}
algae_data
```

## Functions

Excellent - we've got data. Now we need to manipulate it. For this we need functions:

* A function is a command that tells R to perform an action!
* A function begins and ends with parentheses: `this_is_a_function()`
* The stuff inside the parentheses are the details of how you want the function to perform its action: `run_this_analysis(on_this_data)`

Let's illustrate this with an example. `algae_data` is a pretty big object. For our next chapter on visualization, it would be nice to have a smaller dataset object to work with. Let's use another `tidyverse` command called `filter` to filter the `algae_data` object. We will need to tell the filter command what to filter out using "logical predicates" (things like equal to: `==`, less than: `<`, greater than: `>`, greater-than-or-equal-to: `<=`, etc.). Let's filter `algae_data` so that only rows where the `chemical_species` is equal to `FAs` (fatty acids) is preserved. This will look like `chemical_species == "FAs"`. Here we go:

```{r, message = FALSE}
filter(algae_data, chemical_species == "FAs")
```

Cool! Now it's just showing us the 18 rows where the chemical_species is fatty acids (FAs). Let's write this new, smaller dataset into a new object. For that we use `<-`, remember?

```{r, message = FALSE}
algae_data_small <- filter(algae_data, chemical_species == "FAs")
algae_data_small
```

Now we have a nice, small table that we can use to practice data visualization. We'll do that in the next chapter.
