I ceratinly do. You can use a question mark ? to get help with many different concepts. You can just put it in front of the thing you want help with. We’ll see an example in just a minute… 3.1.2 Syntax Throughout this book, we’ll use this &lt;notation&gt; to indicate a place where the requested item that corresponds to your situation. For example, if I am instructed to run this command: print(&quot;&lt;your_name_here&gt;&quot;), I would type: print(&quot;Luke&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Luke&quot; Computers are very powerful but can be dumb at times. They are not very good with unexpected characters - they are often particularly sensitive when it comes to spaces , slashes \\ /, equal signs = (vs. ==), and quotes &quot;. This book will try to warn you when syntax issues may arise. To try and prevent issues, this book will also use snake case (see the image below) - consider doing the same to avoid problems! 3.1.3 Paths To analyze data on your own computer, you will need to know the “path” to your data. This is essentially the street address of your data on your computer’s hard drive. Paths look different on Mac and PC. On Mac: /Users/lucasbusta/Documents/sample_data_set.csv (note the forward slashes!) On PC: C:\\My Computer\\Documents\\sample_data_set.csv (note the backward slashes!) You can quickly find paths to files via the following: On Mac: Locate the file in Finder. Right-click on the file, hold the Option key, then click “Copy as Pathname” On PC: Locate the file in Windows Explorer. Hold down the Shift key then right-click on the file. Click “Copy As Path” 3.2 Functions Ok, we’ve got some bookkeeping out of the way. Let’s get down to working with data! For this we need functions: A function is a command that tells R to perform an action! A function begins and ends with parentheses: this_is_a_function() The stuff inside the parentheses are the details of how you want the function to perform its action: run_this_analysis(on_this_data) Let’s illustrate this with an example. We’re going to use a function from the tidyverse called read_csv. We’ll use it to read some data from a path on our computer. We’ll run read_csv(&quot;&lt;path_to_your_data&gt;&quot;). Note the use of QUOTES! Those are necessary. Also make sure your path uses appropriate slashes for your operating system. # read_csv() 3.3 Load the tidyverse library/package library(tidyverse) 3.4 Read in the algae_chemistry data. The quotes are critical! ## PC = forward slash ## Mac = backward slash algae_chemistry &lt;- read_csv(“/Users/lucasbusta/Desktop/algae_data.csv”) 3.5 Display the contents of the dataset algae_chemistry 3.6 Let’s filter the dataset to only show abundances of fatty acids (“FAs”) algae_chemistry_small &lt;- filter(algae_chemistry, chemical_species == “FAs”) "]
